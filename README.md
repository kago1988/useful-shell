(Hobby) A few very basic but useful shell commands


```
cd  # switches automatically to /home/user 
cd ..  # switches automatically one file in the hierachy up 
cd folder  # switches automatically into the folder named 'folder' 
cd -  # switches into the last folder 
pwd # print working directory 
ls  # list all visible files and folders 
ls -a  # list all files and folders 
ls -l  # list all visible files and folders in the long format 
ls -al  # list all files and folders in the long format 
mkdir abc  # create a folder 
touch file.txt  # create file.txt
CTRL a  # jump to the beginning of the shell command 
CTRL e  # jump to the end of the shell command 
CTRL k  # delete everything in the shell command that comes after the cursor 
cp /music/songs/song_1.mp3 .  # copies the mp3 into the current directory 
cp /music/songs/song_1.mp3 /music/songs/song_2.mp3 .  # copies the two mp3s into the current directory 

```
